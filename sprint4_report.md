## What's New (User Facing)

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

This sprint we have been mainly discussing and planing what is going to be expected at the end of the semester from not only our proffesor but also the clients. We talked about if a moscot like duolingo would be nessacary or if just having multiple animals as the motivational animation. We also decided that we will use css since the language is able to easily use image effects to make animations of still images. We also added the birthday sign in sicne it will be the easiest way to get the residents to remember their login.
