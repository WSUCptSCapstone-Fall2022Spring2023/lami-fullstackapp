# Sprint 3 Report (11/10/22 - 12/09/2022)

## What's New (User Facing) (Editing from last sprint)
 * further improvment of the functions and interfaces that were stated in the last sprint

## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

In this sprint we werent really able to do a whole lot other than minor improvements and fixes to the previous sprints added functions and interfaces. This has been mostly due to the fact that all team members have many time consuming finals/final projects that were being worked on at the same time. 

## Unfinished Work

Since we were unable to work a lot on this project The unfinished work is more or less the same. In this sprint we have made soeme decent progress but there are a few things that we havent been able to finish due to time and other classes. For one, we are trying to have the device scale better when it is flipped horizontal since if flipped right now its scaling is very bad. Also, we havent been able to impliment the notification sound, this is soemthing that has been on the back burner for this sprint but will most likly be tackled for the next sprint.
