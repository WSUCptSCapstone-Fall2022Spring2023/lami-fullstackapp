# LAMI Fullstack Application

## Project summary

This project is an application for the phone and website so residents and caretakers at the LAMI house can track medication taken and how well that medication is working for the residents. 

### Additional information about the project

The application will be able to work on phone and online and be able to seperate caretaker and resident accounts. The resident accoutn will track the medications of that specific person and iform them when its time to take medication and occasionally ask for serveys of the medication to make sure it working properly. Then the caretaker accoutn will allow them to see every residents account and upcoming medication along with if they took their latest doses.This allows the caretakers to be able to make sure everyone is on top of their medication without personally checking on them.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before running the installation instructions below (e.g., git, which versions of Ruby/Rails)
To get this application to work for the oline application we will be connecting the application to the already existing LAMI house website so no downloading will be needed. However, for the phone insallation it would be best to downlaod the code from the git website and make a shortcut for the code so it can used as an app on the phone. 

### Add-ons

No add ons.

### Installation Steps

No instructiosn for installation yet, will be added as we move ahead to more progressed versions of the project

## Functionality

So far we just have the same code as the last team that worked on this application, and what they demonstrated was an app that could be set up to have a medication reminder and set up that timer for the medication. This was doen through and in app btton that sent you to another screen that allowed you to input the times of the reminder and the type of medication that was needed. 


## Known Problems

The only problem that was stated by the last years team was that you couldnt set a timer to remind during sleep hours, however this may end up working in our favor since the client wants to make sure that the timer doesnt go off during the night waking the residents.
