Update your `README.md` using the template below. We are specifically interested in the installation instructions (e.g., all the gems, how to load real or seed data, etc.). This sample README was developed for a Rails project, so you can swap the "Gems" section of the "Installation" instructions to include add-ons that are relevant to you.

If any of the sections in this template grows to more than one screen, consider placing it in its own file and linking to it from this file. Those files could live in a subdirectory called `docs`.

**Make sure to check out the repo anew and test your installation instructions.**

Provide a README file with the following information:

# LAMI Fullstack Application

## Project summary

This project is an application for the phone and website so residents and caretakers at the LAMI house can track medication taken and how well that medication is working for the residents. 

### Additional information about the project

The application will be able to work on phone and online and be able to seperate caretaker and resident accounts. The resident accoutn will track the medications of that specific person and iform them when its time to take medication and occasionally ask for serveys of the medication to make sure it working properly. Then the caretaker accoutn will allow them to see every residents account and upcoming medication along with if they took their latest doses.This allows the caretakers to be able to make sure everyone is on top of their medication without personally checking on them.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

TODO: List what a user needs to have installed before running the installation instructions below (e.g., git, which versions of Ruby/Rails)
To get this application to work for the oline application we will be connecting the application to the already existing LAMI house website so no downloading will be needed. However, for the phone insallation it would be best to downlaod the code from the git website and make a shortcut for the code so it can used as an app on the phone. 

### Add-ons

No add ons.

### Installation Steps

TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you mention `bundle install`).
Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. 


## Functionality

TODO: Write usage instructions. Structuring it as a walkthrough can help structure this section,
and showcase your features.


## Known Problems

TODO: Describe any known issues, bugs, odd behaviors or code smells. 
Provide steps to reproduce the problem and/or name a file or a function where the problem lives.

## Additional Documentation

TODO: Provide links to additional documentation that may exist in the repo, e.g.,
  * Sprint reports
  * User links

## License

If you haven't already, add a file called `LICENSE.txt` with the text of the appropriate license.
