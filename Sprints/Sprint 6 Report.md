## Work Summary (Developer Facing)
The main goal of this sprint was to tidy thinsg up within the application. WHat that consisted of was changing soem small things within the UI and fisxing some minor problems that we would run into when testing again. There is also implimenting the use of animation to help motivate the users to use the app continueously, like how duolingo does it. After that time was allocated to making the poster presentaion so that we could formally present our project to the judges.
