Provide a one paragraph synposis of what your team accomplished this sprint. Don't repeat the "What's New" list of features. Instead, help the instructor understand how you went about the work described there, any barriers you overcame, and any significant learnings for your team.

During this sprint we accomplisedh the creation of the team, seting up the github repository, getting the old code to work on both computers, meeting with the client, and getting coaching from the teacher. Currently we have last years teams code and we havent started implimenting things yet since we want to draw ups of what the program will loook like and what is of a higher priority. By the next sprint we will have started coding and moving ahead with implimentations for the application.
