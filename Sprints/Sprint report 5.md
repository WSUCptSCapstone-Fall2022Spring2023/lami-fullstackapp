## Work Summary (Developer Facing)

In this sprint we were able to start working on what we were planning from the previous sprint. SO what we spent the majority of this sprint was revamping the UI even furhter to give it a fresher and more modern look while also reintroducing soem eatures from the old UI while also improving apon them. Another thing we started on was soem tests and test cases. Unfortunatly we couldnt get any of the test done entirly so it is left out of this sprint but by the next sprint we will have a few test cases done along with a couple of other features for the app including a progress bar for daily medication. 

## Unfinished Work

Some of the unfinished work that will be worked on in the next sprint is the test cases. We have started work on them as stated in the previous section and we have some work on the tests we have doen byt not enough to be able to giev the proper report on the tests. Also another feature we are working on is a meter that fills up as you take all your medication for the day. This will most likly be doen by next sprint.
